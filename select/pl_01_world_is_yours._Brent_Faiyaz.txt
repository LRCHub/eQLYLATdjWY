Let me hear it from the top
Whatever you want, babe
Whatever your heart desires
It's whatever you're thinking
If it makes you feel inspired
I won't get riled up, no
I'll be tender with my touch,
I swear
You can believe in me, girl,
that's called trust
Have me your way
Here I stand, girl (Oh)
Have me your way
There's nothing
you can't have from me
And the world is yours
I'll write your name
on every shore
I'll do it for you, my baby
(And if I'm your man)
Oh, yeah, it's whatever I can
We can run it up,
that ain't 'bout nothing
(Every day)
We can do it up,
that ain't 'bout nothing, yeah
We can run it up,
that ain't 'bout nothing
(Baby, I'll give you)
I'll give you my love,
that ain't 'bout nothing, yeah
I don't compare to no one
(No, I don't)
They don't make me
feel like you, girl
I'm talking no one (Mm)
Forever is the only outcome
If I'm out of wrong,
I'm gonna fix it
If I'm with you, then I want
Have me your way
Here I stand, girl (Yeah)
Have me your way
There's nothing
you can't have from me
And the world is yours
(Is yours)
I'll write your name
on every shore
(Every sea and shore)
And if I'm your man,
it's whatever I can
We can run it up,
that ain't 'bout nothing
(Every day)
We can do it up,
that ain't 'bout nothing, yeah
(Anything you want)
We can run it up,
that ain't 'bout nothing
(I'll do it, baby, I'll give you)
I'll give you my love,
(My love, baby)
that ain't 'bout nothing, yeah
Have me your way
Here I stand (Yeah)
Have me your way
There's nothing
you can't have from me
And the world is yours,
it's whatever you want
And if I'm your man,
it's whatever I can
