I know this world seems so big
And everything seems so out of reach
The sky is high and the walk is wide
You've just don't know what you've got yet

It's in the palm of your hands
It's right in front of where you stand

If you believe, everything you dream, will come true
If you can love no matter how you hurt, Love will come to you, back to you.
This world is yours

At times I know it's going to be hard
When you think you can't go on
But there's a plan for you just let your heart follow through
Come on, I promise you can do it all
Cause when you fall you can always start again
Your future's right in front of where you stand

If you believe, everything you dream, will come true
If you can love no matter how you hurt, Love will come to you, back to you.
This world is yours

Climb a mountain
Cross the ocean
Sail the river until it opens
Make good friends, listen hard
Let it out, and dance on.

If you believe, everything you dream, will come true
If you can see there's nothing that can be too big for you
If you can see, if you can believe, if you can dream
This world is yours
This world is yours
